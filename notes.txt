while i<3:
....print("")

for i in [0,1,2]
i takes the first value in the list 

or 

for i in range(3) 
range returns 0 ,1 ,2

or if we are not using i in the loop then we can write _ that means its just for navigating in the loop and we dont need a variable

for _ in range(3)

another way of print in pyton is 
print("new\n"* 3, end="")
